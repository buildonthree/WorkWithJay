      With over a decade of experience in the digital space, I've evolved from a creative professional into a comprehensive ecommerce specialist. My journey began in 2012 as a freelance creative, mastering tools like Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects to deliver compelling graphics and video content for brands. In 2014, I expanded into web design, helping clients establish their digital presence through various platforms. When I discovered Shopify in 2016, I found my true passion—its intuitive UI/UX became my platform of choice, and I've since developed deep expertise as a Shopify Partner, understanding the platform's full capabilities for both ecommerce and non-ecommerce applications.
      My Shopify proficiency caught the attention of agencies in 2020, opening doors to the digital marketing world where I quickly absorbed best practices in media buying, retargeting strategies, email marketing workflows, and platform optimization. Today, I serve as an ecommerce specialist who guides businesses through the entire journey—from product preparation and platform setup to launch and strategic marketing campaigns. I pride myself on staying ahead of industry trends to deliver results-driven solutions that help my clients thrive in the digital marketplace.
